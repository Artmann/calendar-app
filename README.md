This is an example calendar app where the event name is used to suggest
the attendees of the event.

It will:
 - Show a list of suggested atteendes based on what you are writing.
 - Autocomplete the name of the attendee that was added.
 - Highlight parts of their names that was used for the suggestion.


A demo version is available at `https://chris-calendar-app.netlify.app/`.

Once that's done, you can start the server localy with: 

```shell
yarn start
```

If you want to run the test suite, you can do that with:
